# Introduction
## Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

> ATM stands for Automated Teller Machines. An ATM is an electronic banking machine that allows customers to withdraw money with an ATM card and perform other banking transactions without the aid of banking staff.

> ATMs are convenient, allowing consumers to perform quick self-service transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, bill payments, and transfers between accounts.

## ATM Design Elements
Although the design of each ATM is different, they all contain the same basic parts

.
> Card reader: This part reads the chip on the front of the card or the magnetic stripe on the back of the card.

> Keypad: The keypad is used by the customer to input information, including personal identification number(PIN), the type of transaction required, and the amount of the         transaction.
> Cash dispenser: Bills are dispensed through a slot in the machine, which is connected to a safe at the bottom of the machine.

> Printer: If required, consumers can request receipts that are printed here. The receipt records the type of transaction, the amount, and the account balance.

> Screen: The ATM issues prompts that guide the consumer through the process of executing the transaction. Information is also transmitted on the screen, such as account information and balances.
